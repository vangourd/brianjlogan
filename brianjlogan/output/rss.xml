&lt;p&gt;During my reading today I was very much surprised to find out that &lt;strong&gt;Fortran&lt;/strong&gt; arrays start at &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; and not 0 (as is more common in programming languages). Even more surprising is that scientific programming languages (data-science) have adopted using 1-based indexing. I googled for a satisfactory explanation and think that Xah's article is a great read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>arrays</category><category>c</category><category>python</category><guid>https://brianjlogan.com/posts/should-array-index-start-at-0-or-1/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2020 17:06:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Home DynamicDNS with CloudFlare Free and Python3</title><link>https://brianjlogan.com/posts/home-dynamicdns-with-cloudflare-free-and-python3/</link><dc:creator>Brian Logan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Picture of hand drawn cloudflare logo" src="https://brianjlogan.com/images/cloudflare/logo.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently setup a new home linux router. One benefit is I now have direct access to the heart of my home network. Including a direct interface to the internet. Here's how I utilized that access and opened a consistent DNS domain to my home network without having to use DynDNS or get a business internet account.&lt;/p&gt;

I had to make sure I updated this post. I am removing the Amazon link because I can't advocate for anyone to purchase the book anymore. I'm sorry it took me so long to update. Unfortunately the book really declines in quality the further you go. It really doesn't target a particular reader very well. It &lt;strong&gt;bores the expert with details of beginner topics&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;confuses the newbie with advanced topics outside of their grasp&lt;/strong&gt;. If you don't know what a variable is you probably aren't capable of understanding async and threading yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently having a blast working through this book learning more about GUI programming with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qt5 Python GUI Programming Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; by B.M. Harwini&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is for this article to give someone a jump start on system automation in smaller mixed environments. You are likely a network engineer or sysadmin who has some experience in the field and has heard a lot about Python or Powershell automation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SaltStack is a wonderful framework to get you automating without having to solve the difficult problems with distributed computing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I have come home at last! This is my real country! I belong here. This is the land I have been looking for all my life, though I never knew it till now...Come further up, come further in!”&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is in-escapable queasiness that grows with your journey through life. As a child you eagerly search for more comprehension of the secret adults hold. The secret of contentedness and understanding with the nature of the world. You observe adults and see their composure as bravery and emotional security.&lt;/p&gt;
