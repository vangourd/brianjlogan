<p><strong>‚ÄúI have come home at last! This is my real country! I belong here. This is the land I have been looking for all my life, though I never knew it till now...Come further up, come further in!‚Äù</strong>
 <em>C.S. Lewis, The Last Battle</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is in-escapable queasiness that grows with your journey through life. As a child you eagerly search for more comprehension of the secret adults hold. The secret of contentedness and understanding with the nature of the world. You observe adults and see their composure as bravery and emotional security. </p>
<p>It is a finely honed facade. We're more mature and experienced than when we were children. The dark no longer scares us mostly because we've been desensitized to it. Mentally place yourself in a dark enough location and you'd be hard pressed to find anyone capable of being comfortable thinking about it.</p>
<p><img alt="Dia Top" src="../../images/diatop.jpg"></p>
<p>With exposure we ignore. We focus on the goal posts. The goal posts move and transform into things like "I need a new job", "I need to pay off my credit card", "I need to buy a nicer house". We settle into thinking of destinations as the journey. It does nicely at distracting us.</p>
<p><img alt="Dia Middle" src="../../images/diamiddle.jpg"></p>
<p>But in many ways the question of <strong>What now?</strong> stalks us and pervades. It is <strong>doubt</strong> and in some ways reasonableness. Humans loathe uncertainty in their lives and confusion. We prefer order and predictability. But if order is for life why do we expect reason in death?</p>
<p><img alt="Dia Bottom" src="../../images/diabottom.jpg"></p>
<p>It is this eventuality that has haunted me and will continue to exist in my life for the rest of it. Existential angst, the <em>Nausea</em>, can be "reasoned" with by saying death cannot be experienced. All major religions address our desire to <em>know</em> but their answers never left me with more than more doubt.</p>
<p>The feeling is familiar yet I have come to terms with it. At least  I have come to a point where thinking about existence and finding peace is surmountable. With religion you might refer to this as a <em>finding of faith or spirit</em> but it is secular for my experience. </p>
<p>S√∏ren Kierkegaard refers to this as a <em>"Leap of faith"</em>.  It is <em>hope</em> in its purest sense. It is against my nature to make an illogical argument for solace but that is where I find my peace. </p>
<p><img alt="Floating" src="../../images/floating.jpg"></p>
<p>It is in the limbo of relinquishing your power of understanding, your desire for control, that you find peace in existence. It is ethereally a part of you, at all times, yet you hardly pay attention to it. </p>
<p>Kierkegaard too emphasizes the importance of <em>inwardness</em>. Although you might find your awakening call <em>externally</em> it is merely the sound to attention. Your growth comes from an <strong>inward journey</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="Meditation" src="../../images/meditation.jpg"></p>
<p>I have found great solace alone in the <em>illogical</em> satisfaction of faith. Preferring to accept "<em>I don't know</em>" as opposed to deciding a truth. I too cannot make this <em>leap</em> without acknowledging it. However I try my best day in and day out to forget the reason for which I live inside this contradiction. Both believing in reason and practicing ignorance. Attempting to make the great movement.</p>
<p>It is easier to forget everything and be. <em>Mindfulness</em>. </p>
