> **“I have come home at last! This is my real country! I belong here. This is the land I have been looking for all my life, though I never knew it till now...Come further up, come further in!”**

There is in-escapable queasiness that grows with your journey through life. As a child you eagerly search for more comprehension of the secret adults hold. The secret of contentedness and understanding with the nature of the world. You look ato adults and think of their composure as bravery and emotional security. 

In some ways it is security. We're more mature and experienced then when we were children. However The goal posts move and transform into things like "I need a new job", "I need to pay off my credit card", "I need to buy a nicer house". We settle into thinking of destinations as the journey. 

But in many ways the question of **What now?** stalks us and pervades and stalks us. It is **doubt** and in some ways reasonableness. Humans loathe uncertainty in their lives and confusion. We prefer order and predictability. One is life, the other is death.

It is this eventuality that has haunted me and will continue to exist in my life for the rest of it. Existential angst, the *Nausea*, can be "reasoned" with by saying death cannot be experienced. Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism all address our desire to *know* but their answers never left me with more than more doubt.

 I'm not as experienced in other religions but from my experience with Christianity I think you might refer to this as a *finding of faith or spirit*. 

Søren Kierkegaard refers to this as a *"Leap of faith"* and I do believe this inescapable feeling is human. It is *hope* in its purest sense. The hoper is what we should strive t obe. 


Scientifically life is responsible for tremendously more chaos and confusion than death. Death is a settling, a completion, an order in itself. Life is a construction with a bit of entropy and loss of energy. Eventually the energy will expire and all the random movements will calm.

But Kierkegaard as well emphasizes the importance of *inwardness* although the *external* is the sound to attention growth comes from an **inward journey**.
