 Being able to quickly prototype and plugin some functionality to an interface will be an extremely valuable tool to have on hand.

Additionally it can be a bit repetitive from chapter to chapter but the forced practice is good to internalize the ritual incantations of Qt and allow for really rapid prototyping.
