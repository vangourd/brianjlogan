After recently taking the CompTIA Security+ Cert on an overnight whim I realize that I should be quantifying some of my SysAdmin knowledge in some discernible way. If for no reason than giving myself a baseline of competency and demonstrating to HR that my skills are up to par. This is a [widely contested](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4182338) discussion and one that I hear nuanced opinions on throughout my career. As someone who has **no college degree** for what I do, a cert is a low hanging fruit to demonstrate my skills to someone who isn't technical. 

## So why the RHEL Cert?

- It's a practical exam where you can demonstrate multiple paths to achieve a desired result. Much like how you would be expected to do at a real tech job.
