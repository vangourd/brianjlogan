**Update: 05/04/2020**
I had to make sure I updated this post. I am removing the Amazon link because I can't advocate for anyone to purchase the book anymore. I'm sorry it took me so long to update. Unfortunately the book really declines in quality the further you go. It really doesn't target a particular reader very well. It **bores the expert with details of beginner topics** and **confuses the newbie with advanced topics outside of their grasp**. If you don't know what a variable is you probably aren't capable of understanding async and threading yet. 

I am currently having a blast working through this book learning more about GUI programming with Python.

 Being able to quickly prototype and plugin some functionality to an interface will be an extremely valuable tool to have on hand. It has some roughspots and some of the code is improperly indented but with Intermediate Python experience you can read between the lines. Additionally it can be a bit repetitive from chapter to chapter but the forced practice is good to internalize the ritual incantations of Qt and allow for really rapid prototyping.
