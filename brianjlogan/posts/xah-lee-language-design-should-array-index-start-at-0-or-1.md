[Xah Lee's Post](http://xahlee.info/comp/comp_lang_array_index_start_0_or_1.html)

During my reading today I was very much surprised to find out that **Fortran** arrays start at **1** and not 0 (as is more common in programming languages). Even more surprising is that scientific programming languages (data-science) have adopted using 1-based indexing. I googled for a satisfactory explanation and think that Xah's article is a great read.
